# stayhome2night
A twitter bot that gives questionable reasons for you to stay home. So nonsensical, you're friends will beg you not to come out.

Just add your tokens into config.json, and run
`node index.js`

or check it out on twitter @stayhome2night

* Word lists were heavily influenced by https://eqi.org/fw_neg.htm & http://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/, though I did edit/add to these lists.

* Twitterbot based off of fourtonfish's Glitch Twitterbot starter code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitterbot?path=README.md:1:0
